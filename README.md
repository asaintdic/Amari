Amari Request and Donation Manager!

This Sinatra webapp was built with nonprofits who accept requests for help or donations for those in need. As an MVP the most essential function is for a user to be able to make a request for particular items (clothing for this particular app), based on several personal attributes. The user has the ability to view all of their requests, and edit or delete requests that theve made in the past.

Branches:
Three featurtes that I would like to include in this app for the future are:
Donors
1) A section where donors can directly view requests made by those in need and fulfill any of their choosing. They should alos be able to make monetary donations..

Admin
2) Admin views and controllers that will allow admins to manage donatations and requests.


Beyond Clothing
3)This was concieved with nonprofits like Goodwill and Well Cloth'd in mind which specifically deal with large quan tities of clothing and have the ability to match doantions to those in need. However, this could grow beyond clothing, managing requests, fulfillments, and donations in any capacity, of any type.
